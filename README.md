# Air Pollutant Tracking Data
This repository contains the code and data for the paper Enhancing Air Pollutant Tracking with ERA5 for Underserved Regions. This project was undertaken as part of the course project for CS269: AI For Climate Change, by Prof. Aditya Grover at UCLA in Fall 2024.

Here, we add combine the HAAQ dataset, provided by the CPCB of India with physical variables from ERA5 to improve air pollutant tracking. We aim to create a machine-learning ready dataset for this task.

For dataset statistics, task description, baselines and visualisations, please refer to the paper. Here, we will only describe how to run the code and use the data.
